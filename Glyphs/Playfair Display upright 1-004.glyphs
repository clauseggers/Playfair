value = "Playfair Display is a transitional design. From the time of enlightenment in the late 18th century, the broad nib quills were replaced by pointed steel pens. This influenced typographical letterforms to become increasingly detached from the written ones. Developments in printing technology, ink and paper making, made it possible to print letterforms of high contrast and fine hairlines.\012\012This design lends itself to this period, and while it is not a revival of any particular design, it take influence from the printer and typeface designer John Baskerville\U2019s designs, the punch-cutter William Martin\U2019s typeface for the \U201CBoydell Shakespeare\U201D (sic) edition, and from the \U201CScotch Roman\U201D designs that followed thereafter.\012\012As the name indicates, Playfair Display is well suited for titling and headlines. It has an extra large x-height and short descenders, that enable it to be set with no leading. Stylistically it can accompany Georgia when Georgia is used for body text.\012\012Playfair includes a full set of small-caps, common ligatures, and discretionary ligatures. For Polish, a set of alternate diacritical characters designed with \U2018kreska\U2019s are included. All European languages using the latin script are supported. A set of eight arrow devices are also included.";
