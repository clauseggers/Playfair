THE PLAYFAIR AXES
=================

After much toing and froing we have settled on these values.


WEIGHT
======
Weight is approximately linearly scaled, except the 'SemiLight' weight, which is only the 360 internal value remapped to 300 to follow the CSS spec.
Internal weight		External weight
360					300
400					400
475					500
550					600
650					700
750					800
900					900

CSS WEIGHT (as per specification)
Value	Common weight name
100		Thin (Hairline)
200		Extra Light (Ultra Light)
300		Light
400		Normal (Regular)
500		Medium
600		Semi Bold (Demi Bold)
700		Bold
800		Extra Bold (Ultra Bold)
900		Black (Heavy)
950		Extra Black (Ultra Black)


WIDTH
=====
Width is linearly scaled, but with normal (external 100) set to internal 75.
[The external widths are rounded to the nearest integers because the Glyphs script "Instance Cooker" only supports integers. Instance Cooker is used to generate the instances.]
Internal width		External width
50					88 (87.5)
75					100
150					113 (112.5)

CSS FONT-STRETCH (as per specification)
Keyword				Percentage		(Instance Cooker Class aka. OS/2 widthClass)
ultra-condensed		50%				1
extra-condensed		62.5%			2
condensed			75%				3
semi-condensed		87.5%			4
normal				100%			5
semi-expanded		112.5%			6
expanded			125%			7
extra-expanded		150%			8
ultra-expanded		200%			9


OPTICAL SIZE
============
Optical size is scaled exponentially, look at the Numbers document "Optical Size instances.numbers" for more information.
Internal optical	External optical
5					5
1200				1200

These following names I have assigned for Playfair. There is not standard naming.

6						Minuscule
7						Miniature
8						Caption
12						Regular
16						SubHeading
