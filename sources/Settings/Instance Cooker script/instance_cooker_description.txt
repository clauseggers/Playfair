Recipe instructions:
1. After a hashtag, enter the axis name (optionally followed by colon and axis tag), e.g. ‘#Weight’ or ‘#Width:wdth’
2. Per line, enter an axis value, followed by a colon, followed by the name particle for the axis position, e.g. ‘75:Condensed’ or ‘190:Extrabold’
3. Mark elidable name particles with an asterisk after the name, e.g. ‘Regular*’
4. If you need to differentiate between internal and external coordinates, write them with a greater sign: internal>external, e.g. ‘115>500:Medium’
5. Write a width class after a vertical bar, e.g. ‘75|3:Condensed’. The weight class will be derived from the external coordinate.
6. Use whitespace and empty lines as you like, write comments before the first hashtag.
