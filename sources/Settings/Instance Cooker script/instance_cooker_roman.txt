These instances are based on the following master settings:
Axes Coordinates: Weight: 360/900, Width: 50/150
With the custom parameter 'Axis Location':
Optical size = [same as master]
Width = 75/150 (Here the 50 width of the masters is scaled to 75)
Weight = [same as master]

Optical Size is specified in points. Refer to the 'Optical Size instances.numbers' spreadsheet in this folder to view and/or edit the relationship between internal and external Optical Size coordinates.

Width Class:

Width narrow master is set to 50, wide to 150 as it has been from the beginning. Must be kept at these values because of layer-switching being defined on these values.

Weight Class:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/opentype/spec/os2#usweightclass
Weight of the ‘regular’ masters is now set at [Glyphs internal: 360]. This makes the Regular instance set at 400 be a little darker, and allows users to specify 300 as a lighter alternative to the regular Regular.

Fill *all* the fields in the master custom parameter ‘Axis Location’.
